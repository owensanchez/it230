- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?

The application was intended to allow students to register for courses at a university. It was required to prevent students from making invalid registrations, such as registering for the same course multiple times.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this application?

I think I organized the code well when creating the application. I split the functionality into multiple methods that each handled a single task, which made the final code clearer.

- Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The console and WPF application designs implement the same functionality with different UIs. The console UI is simple and text-based, requiring the user to type all their choices one by one. The WPF version allows the user to register by clicking courses, which is easier for users.

- How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

I approached development by trying to run the code, correcting any errors, and then running it again until the applications worked correctly. This is a general strategy that should work well for all my software projects in the future.

- Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

I had to be innovative when creating the WPF version of the final application because it used classes in a clever way that allowed for simpler code once I figured out how it worked.
